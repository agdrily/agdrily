# Research

Research is performed in labs which have a level, each research has a total time split between the levels. for example

  Research takes
  10 minues level 2
  20 minutes level 1

  and you have
  2 level 2 labs
  4 level 1 labs

  so it would take
  (10 / 2) minutes to finish level 2 requirements
  (20 / 4) minutes to finish level 1 requirements

Labs would be able to perform the research for levels below but would focus on the highest level they can.
