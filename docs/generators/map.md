# Maps

Maps will be procedurally generated based on the seed for that agdrily map tile.

The colony core will always come through at sea level

# Seeds

 - 1 - flat distance                a-k   how far around the colony core to be flat
 - 2 - max height above sea level   a-g   maximum terrain height above sea level
 - 3 - max ocean depth              a-d   deepest ocean
 - 4 - RNGSeed1                     a-z
 - 5 - RNGSeed2                     a-z
 - 6 - RNGSeed3                     a-z
 - 7 - RNGSeed4                     a-z

Seeds will be generated for each tile.

The world map will be generated using the seed `agdrily`
