# Concept

A general outline of the plan

## Shameless Admissions

Before any ideas get put to paper lets admit exactly where these ideas came from and take it from there.

 - Factorio
 - Rimworld
 - Prison Architect

## Core idea

The aim from a meta perspective is have the game developed open source and allow anyone through github to propose changes.

You are the assigned administrator of a colony and your job is to make the colony bigger by any means you see fit.

Your colony core are dropped (setup) at a location on a square grid and you then build out from that.

## Setting

agdrily is a naturally occuring dyson sphere. Its internal surface is so massive that even with tens of thousands of colonies they can be so spaced out that none will touch (read have to be rendered on another players screen).

The colony core is a large spike that is rammed through the outer wall of agdrily and is visible on both sides. Players can build at any level

The agdrily trade network functions through firing the resources around the outer edge of agdrily at a calculate angle and speed so that it hits the collection bin of the targeted colony core.

## Player Interaction

Colony spawns will not provide players with infinite resources or all the resources they might need.

Simple interaction will occur through the market which will allow for buy/sell of any resource. Player sets the price they want to sell at and the maximum buy price.

To be more targeted players will be able to create private connections
