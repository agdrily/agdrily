# Maps

All maps are _infinate_ or near to, with agdrily having a radius of 1AU the surface area will be in the region of 12.5AU^2 this gives more than enough space for the colony cores to be an extreme distance apart.

1 to 5 is outside the sphere in space and receives no natural light, requires heating.
6 to 9 is the crust between the outside and inside layers.
10 to 18 can be solid, terrain generation will have to come in here.
19 & 20 are always open sky

The colony core stretches from 4 to 16 making it 13 levels tall.

Pipes can be built on any level as long as they connect to either a building connector, a multi-level coupler, the terrain or another pipe no more than 5 from a any other connector.

Buildings can only be built on flat terrain in an empty space for their size.
